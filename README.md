Cinematch AI is a Machine Learning–based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on their metadata such as genre, cast, and storyline. It uses content-based filtering to find similar movies and generate personalized recommendations.

The system processes movie metadata from the TMDb 5000 dataset and applies Natural Language Processing techniques to compute similarity between movies.
